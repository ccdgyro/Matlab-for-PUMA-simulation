# Matlab-for-PUMA-simulation
This is my first demo for learning Robotics.
It mainly includes the kinematics simulation of the puma robot.
I have made some modifications based on this demo：https://github.com/PascPeli/Puma-Robot-Simulation.
(1)The GUI can read easily because it has been modified to Chinese.
(2)Added some button controls to enrich the demonstration.Including record Joint motion and replay, simple visual control and gesture interaction based leap motion controller.
